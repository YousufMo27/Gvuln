        <h1>My Research</h1>
        <p>In the annals of cybersecurity, My groundbreaking research opened up new frontiers in password security. My work, spanning over a decade, led to the creation of passwords that were not only resilient but also user-friendly. Among  notable findings was the revelation that capitalising the entire password added a layer of complexity that was often overlooked. In my most celebrated paper, I underscored the importance of this aspect, hinting that the password might contain capital letters exclusively. It's a clue that has stood the test of time, forming a critical part of my legacy.
        </p>
        <p>My second breakthrough was a game-changer in the realm of password protection. I proposed that special characters should be strategically positioned within passwords to thwart potential attacks. My research pointed out that by placing special characters in the second and fourth positions, passwords became significantly more robust. This positioning of special characters was a key innovation I championed. It's no surprise that these special characters would find a place in my own password, albeit in an unknown order.</p>
        <p>As my career unfolded, I consistently advocated for the perfect balance between security and memorability. One of my most intriguing contributions was the discovery that a password's length played a pivotal role in its strength. In an obscure interview, I explained that my password is exactly seven characters long. What's more, I subtly alluded to the fact that the last two characters of my password were '61,' a secret that remains hidden to this day. Together, these clues offer a tantalising glimpse into the mind of a password pioneer, one that could unlock the secrets of my digital kingdom.</p>
